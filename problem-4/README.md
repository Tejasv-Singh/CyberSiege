## ü§î Assumptions Made
The input data for the problems was either hardcoded or derived from the challenge prompt.

The encoded strings, patterns, or hash values were specific to the CyberSiege CTF challenge environment.

The logic is specific to the challenge prompt; generalization has not been applied unless needed for the solution.
